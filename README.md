# Challenge_Mole
The objective of the project is to build a tool that detects moles on the human body that need to be handled by doctors.

## Description
The project is divided into 2 steps represented in the folder structure of this repository.
1. Code : This folder has the python code used for training the neural network (CNN model). The dataset used for training has images of benign and malignant skin cancers.
2. Demo - Mole Detection.ipynb : This program runs the interface that detects cancerous moles based on the image uploaded.


## Getting Started
Dependencies needed before running the program. 

    pip install reqt.txt

Executing program: Run the file Demo - Mole Detection.ipynb



## Output

## Next Steps 
The following steps would improve the image classification further:
1. Using a multi-input neural network - The features like age, gender and localization from the metadata can be added along with the images to the neural network. 
2. Using a pre-trained model - Several pre-trained models are available for image classification. VGG-16, ResNet50, Xception are a few examples. Using pre-trained model could save on training time and also give access to the tools alerady available online.
