# Challenge_Mole
The objective of the project is to build a tool that detects moles on the human body that need to be handled by doctors.

# Description
The project is divided into 4 steps represented in the folder structure of this repository.


# Getting Started
Dependencies needed before running the program.

# Next Steps 
The following steps would improve the image classification further:
1. Using a multi-input neural network - The features like age, gender and localization from the metadata can be added along with the images to the neural network. 
2. Using a pre-trained model - Several pre-trained models are available for image classification. VGG-16, ResNet50, Xception are a few examples. Using pre-trained model could save on training time and also give access to the tools alerady available online.
